# SJTU CS2303 OSLABS

This is a repo for SJTU CS2303 Operating System Labs.

## File List

- `/src` : All the source code for this project. For modified Linux kernel source code, I've tried my best to set **MODIFIED** tag with comments at the places where I made modification. But there may be still something missing :)
- `/scripts` : Some scripts for data analysis.
- `/img` : Some images in the report.

In addition, If you want the entire modified Linux source code, please feel free to contact me. <a href="mailto:zhao_ziqian@sjtu.edu.cn">zhao_ziqian@sjtu.edu.cn</a>
